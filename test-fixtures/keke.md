Public Outcry Preserves Lu Xun’s Cigarette Portrait in Shaoxing Heritage Site

公众呼声守住鲁迅“叼烟像”，绍兴景区画作得以保留

The debate over a modest wooden‑cut mural in Shaoxing’s “Lu Xun Hometown” scenic area has taken on a life of its own, drawing more than a hundred self‑described “enthusiastic” citizens into a public argument about whether a celebrated writer’s image should be altered. 

关于绍兴“鲁迅故里”景区一幅并不起眼的木刻壁画，争论意外发酵，吸引了上百位自称“热心”的市民参与到一场公共讨论：这位著名作家的形象，究竟该不该被改变。

At its core the controversy is simple: a painting that shows the early‑20th‑century literary titan, Lu Xun, with a cigarette between his lips has been left untouched for 22 years; a single netizen asked that it be replaced with a version of the author clenching his fist—a pose that would, in her view, send a healthier, more uplifting message to today’s youth. The response, however, has been anything but modest.

争议的核心其实很简单：这幅壁画描绘了20世纪初的文学巨匠鲁迅，嘴里叼着一支香烟。22年来，它一直保持原样未动。然而，一位网友提出应将其换成鲁迅握拳的形象——她认为，这样能向当代青年传递更健康、更积极的讯息。但随之而来的反应，却一点也不简单。

On August 22, a user known only as Ms. Sun posted on Weibo that the mural “misleads young people” by glorifying smoking. She went further, filing an official complaint with the local authorities and suggesting that the picture be swapped for a more “positive” depiction. 

8月22日，一位仅以“孙女士”为名的用户在微博发文称，这幅壁画“误导年轻人”，美化了吸烟。她甚至向当地主管部门正式投诉，建议用“更积极”的形象取而代之。

Within days, the complaint had been amplified by a handful of media outlets, some of which highlighted an odd detail from Sun’s profile – a reference to “only nicotine pouches were allowed,” a product that is illegal in China. 

几天之内，这一投诉被多家媒体放大报道。其中一些还注意到孙女士个人简介里的一个奇怪细节——她提到“只允许使用尼古丁袋”，而这一产品在中国属非法。

The mention sparked speculation that the complaint might have been driven by personal or commercial motives rather than genuine moral concern. Sun’s account was subsequently deleted, leaving many to wonder whether the episode was a manufactured flashpoint.

这一点引发了猜测：投诉背后，或许并非单纯的道德关切，而是夹杂了个人或商业动机。随后，孙女士的账号被删除，使得这一事件更显扑朔迷离，让许多人怀疑，这是否是一次被制造出来的舆论热点。
